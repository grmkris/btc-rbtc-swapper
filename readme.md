## Description
This service main purpose is to be a "balancing" tool for lnsov bridge.  
The lnsov bridge is an exchange that offers rbtc / lightning swaps. It should maintain ~50% of funds in lightning wallet and 50% funds in rsk wallet.  
It uses lightning loop service to do either:
 - loop in 
   - when lightning balance falls below X%
     1. this service sends funds from rsk wallet to RSK federation address
     2. after 100 confirmations RSK federation address sends funds to "rsk-paired" bitcoin wallet 
     3. this service is monitoring "rsk-paried" bitcoin address for new transactions
     4. after new transaction is found it sends it to lightning wallet
     5. after funds arrive to lightning wallet it initiates a loop in
 - loop out
   - when RBTC balance falls below X%
     1. this service initiates a loop out 
     2. loop out service sends funds to our lightning wallet
        - **it is possible to loop out to specific bitcoin address, so by modfying step1, we might skip straight to step4 and save 1 onchain transaction**
     3. this service monitors loop service for loop SWAP status, 
     4. when swap status=COMPLETE it sends onchain transaction to "rsk-paired" bitcoin wallet
     5. this service sends coins from "rsk-paired" wallet to RSK-Federation address
     6. after 100 confirmations funds are available in RSK wallet
